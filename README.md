# -Analyze-Electric-Vehicle-Stations-with-Python
In this project, I explored and analyzed a US Department of Energy dataset of alternate fuel stations, including electric vehicle charging stations.

I started by exploring the different kinds of fuel, locations, and other station properties in the dataset. Then used Boolean masks to filter the dataset down to public-access electric vehicle charging stations.

I analyzed the different kinds of ownership of public-access charging stations, determine which states have the most stations, and do a mini-analysis of the west coast alone.
